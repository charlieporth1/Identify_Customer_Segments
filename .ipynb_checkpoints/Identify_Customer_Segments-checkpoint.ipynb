    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",

So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",

    "You've assessed and cleaned the demographics data, then scaled and transformed them. Now, it's time to see how the data clusters in the principal components space. In this substep, you will apply k-means clustering to the dataset and use the average within-cluster distances from each point to their assigned cluster's centroid to decide on a number of clusters to keep.\n",

    "- Then, compute the average difference from each point to its assigned cluster's center. **Hint**: The KMeans object's `.score()` method might be useful here, but note that in sklearn, scores tend to be defined so that larger is better. Try applying it to a small, toy dataset, or use an internet search to help your understanding.\n",
    "- Perform the above two steps for a number of different cluster counts. You can then see how the average distance decreases with an increasing number of clusters. However, each additional cluster provides a smaller net benefit. Use this fact to select a final number of clusters in which to group the data. **Warning**: because of the large size of the dataset, it can take a long time for the algorithm to resolve. The more clusters to fit, the longer the algorithm will take. You should test for cluster counts through at least 10 clusters to get the full picture, but you shouldn't need to test for a number of clusters above about 30.\n",
    "- Once you've selected a final number of clusters to use, re-fit a KMeans instance to perform the clustering operation. Make sure that you also obtain the cluster assignments for the general demographics data, since you'll be using them in the final Step 3.3."

If we think the company's customer base to be universal, then the cluster assignment proportions should be fairly similar between the two. If there are only particular segments of the population that are interested in the company's products, then we should see a mismatch from one to the other. If there is a higher proportion of persons in a cluster for the customer data compared to the general population (e.g. 5% of persons are assigned to a cluster for the general population, but 15% of the customer data is closest to that cluster's centroid) then that suggests the people in that cluster to be a target audience for the company. On the other hand, the proportion of the data in a cluster being larger in the general population than the customer data (e.g. only 2% of customers closest to a population centroid that captures 6% of the data) suggests that group of persons to be outside of the target demographics.\n",

Alternatively, you can use the `.inverse_transform()` method of the PCA and StandardScaler objects to transform centroids back to the original data space and interpret the retrieved values directly.\n",
